where my servers live. they purr when healthy.

---

### the setup

hetzner cloud, provisioned with terraform, configured with nixos. everything declarative, everything reproducible. if a server explodes i can just... make another one. like a phoenix but fluffier.

secrets live in 1password. ssh keys get generated by terraform and tucked safely into the vault.

---

### what lives here

**matrix** - chat server, because privacy matters and self-hosting is cozy
**memos** - tiny notes to myself, like leaving post-its around but digital
**firefly** - tracking where my money goes (spoiler: not responible stuff probably)
**affine** - notion-like thing for when my brain needs organizing

---

### commands

`direnv allow` and you're in the shell. then:

---

### adding a new server 

1. add it to `servers` in terraform.tfvars
2. `tf apply` to birth the box
3. make a home for it in `nixos/hosts/<name>/`
4. introduce it in `flake.nix`
5. `deploy <name>` to give it life

### notes to self

- acme certs renew automatically, stop checking on them
- the cloudflare api token needs dns edit permissions

*meow*
